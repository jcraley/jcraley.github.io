            <h1>Research overview</h1>
            <p>
                My research work at Johns Hopkins has focused primarily on developing machine learning algorithms with
                clinical applications to epilepsy.
                Specifically, I have investigated using deep learning and signal processing for feature extraction from
                electroencephalography (EEG) signals collected in long term epilepsy monitoring.
                My work uses these features to perform two main tasks, seizure detection and focal onset localization.
            </p>

            <h1>Deep Seizure Detection</h1>

            <p>
                In this project, I have designed a hybrid CNN-BLSTM model for seizure detection.
                This model performs feature extraction from short windows of raw EEG signal using a convolutional neural
                network.
                After these features are extracted, a BLSTM layer is used for detecting seizures.
                This hybrid combination is designed to combine powerful CNN based feature extraction with recurrent
                neural network to identify seizures in long EEG recordings.
            </p>

            <h1>Localizing Seizure Onset</h1>
            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
                My research also focuses on the complimentary task of localizing onset zones in focal epilepsy.
                To perform this task, I have worked to develop models of seizure propagation.
                Using a hand designed network of connections, these models track seizure activity as it spreads
                spatially through the EEG recording.
                This work leverages approaches from both deep learning and graphical models to combine biologically
                informed modeling with powerful neural network feature extraction.
