            <p>Jeff Craley is a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Johns Hopkins
                University. His research applies machine learning and signal processing to develop algorithms to assist
                in clinical epilepsy monitoring and diagnosis. Specifically, his work tracks the onset and spread of
                seizure activity in long term clinical EEG recordings using novel models of the underlying neurological
                phenomena.</p>

            <p>He received his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Boston University in 2015. He earned a B.S. and B.A.
                from Virginia Tech in Aerospace Engineering and English Literature, respectively, in 2011. Intrigued by
                the unique set of technical challenges and motivated by potential improvements in patient care, Jeff
                plans to continue working in engineering for healthcare applications after completing his graduate
                studies.</p>
